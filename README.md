The kind of thing you might find on youtube.

There's a huge amount left to explore here.

I really want to push this closer to **personalized education**, 
which might be possible through the use of another project which
helps you "remember" (i.e. keep a record of) everything you see
on your computer - called [rem](https://github.com/jasonjmcghee/rem).
And / or other mechanisms to keep a record of all of your knowledge
via an embedding space that an LLM can perform RAG on.

Contributions welcome!

Things I'd love to add:

- [ ] Local model support (mistral + XTTSv2)
- [ ] Settings to choose models (3.5 / 4 / local, hd vs not)
- [ ] Animations?
